      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&#39;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&#39;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&#39;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Santa Ynez River Water Quality</title>
      <link>/blog/1/01/01/project3/</link>

      <description>The quality of water within a watershed affects people who rely on surficial water for drinking, as well as the local wildlife. The Santa Ynez River flows into the Gibraltar Reservoir and Lake Cachuma and water is diverted from these reservoirs to nearby cities. The Santa Ynez Watershed supplies water to residents within the City of Santa Barbara, Goleta, Montecito, and other towns. Since 1998, water quality measurements have been taken along the Santa Ynez River.</description>

      <description>From 1999 to 2017, physical characteristics of snowshoe hares were observed and recorded in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest within Alaska (Kielland et al. 2017). This project utilizes the data obtained from this study to visualize the weight and sex of the observed snowshoe hares. In addition, this project explores the summary statistics of the recorded weights for both female and male snowshoe hares.</description>

      <title>Examining Runoff Ratio in Santa Cruz Creek Sub-basin</title>
      <link>/blog/1/01/01/project4/</link>

      <description>To understand the hydrological processes specific to a particular watershed, it is important to understand how much runoff is generated within the area. The runoff ratio for a particular watershed can be calculated if there are good records of precipitation and discharge within the watershed. In the Santa Ynez Watershed, Santa Barbara County maintains a record of precipitation at Lake Cachuma and the US Geological Survey records discharge at the Santa Cruz sub-basin, which is near Lake Cachuma.</description>

      <title>Gibraltar Reservoir Capacity</title>
      <link>/blog/1/01/01/project2/</link>

      <description>Construction of Gibraltar Reservoir finished in 1920. The capacity of the reservoir was supposed to be slightly over 20,000 acre-feet, but sedimentation had already reduced the water storage capacity of the reservoir to about 15,000 acre-feet. Since 1920, Gibraltar has faced issues from sedimentation. In 1949, the City of Santa Barbara had to raise Gibraltar Dam due to the amount of sediment accumulating within its confines. Raising the dam maintained the water storage capacity of about 15,000 acre-feet.</description>

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&#39;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
